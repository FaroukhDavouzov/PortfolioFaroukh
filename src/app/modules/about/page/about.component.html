    <p>Hello I'm Faroukh Davouzov. I'm 22 years old and I live in Belgium.</p>
    <p>I'm a 3rd year applied computer science student at Hogeschool Vives in Kortrijk. My main focus are mobile and web development.</p>
    <p>After my studies I plan to study 2 years further for a master in applied computer science at the VUB in Brussel.</p>
    <p>During my studies and internship I have gathered quite a bit of knowledge in these fields. You can check out the projects I made in my portfolio.</p>
